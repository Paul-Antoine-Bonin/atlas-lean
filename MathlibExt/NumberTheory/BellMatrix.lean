# Bell matrices

A Bell matrix is the Riordan array `(g(X), X * g(X))`. The source works over integer power
series normalized by `g(0) = 1`; here this is generalized to power series over a commutative ring
whose constant coefficient is a unit, the usual condition needed for a ring-valued Riordan array.
