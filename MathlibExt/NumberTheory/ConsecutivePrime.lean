/-- Two natural numbers are consecutive primes when they are prime, strictly ordered, and no
prime lies strictly between them.

This packages the usual meaning of successive primes `pₖ, pₖ₊₁` used in the source papers.

/-- A nonempty, strictly increasing list consisting of a contiguous block of primes.

See the sources cited on `AreConsecutivePrimes` for occurrences of blocks
`pₖ, pₖ₊₁, …, pₘ` of consecutive primes.

/-- A contiguous block of primes whose entries all satisfy an additional predicate `P`.

This covers, for example, the factorial- and primorial-bounded blocks in the source papers by
choosing the corresponding predicate `P`.
