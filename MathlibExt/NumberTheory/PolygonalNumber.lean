# Polygonal numbers

This file formalizes the polygonal-number family from Zhi-Wei Sun's
"On universal sums of polygonal numbers" (Sci. China Math. 58 (2015), 1367--1396).

The source defines, for `m = 3, 4, ...` and `n = 0, 1, 2, ...`,
`p_m(n) = (m - 2) * C(n, 2) + n`.

The source's geometric polygonal interpretation assumes `3 ≤ s`.
The Lean definition below is the total natural-number extension of that
binomial formula to all `s : ℕ`, using `Nat.choose` so no unintended
truncated-subtraction semantics enter the definition itself.
