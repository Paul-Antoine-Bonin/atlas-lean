# Conway–Hofstadter-like sequences

This file formalizes the `k`-sequences introduced by John A. Pelesko in
*Generalizing the Conway-Hofstadter $10,000 Sequence*:

/-- The one-based residue convention used in Pelesko's recurrence: a zero residue modulo `m`
is represented by `m` itself. -/
def conwayHofstadterResidue (a m : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  if a % m = 0 then m else a % m

/-- A Conway–Hofstadter-like sequence of order `k`.

For `n ≥ 3`, the two recursive indices add to `n`. The helper
`conwayHofstadterResidue` implements the source's explicit convention that residue zero modulo
`n - 1` is written as `n - 1`, rather than as zero. -/
