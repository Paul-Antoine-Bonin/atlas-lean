/--
Young's correspondence between reverse multiples and paths in the associated Young graph,
including the edge-label reconstruction of the digits in the even- and odd-length cases:
`(g, k)` reverse multiples with an even (respectively odd) number of base-`g` digits
correspond bijectively to paths from the starting node to even (respectively odd) pivot
nodes, with digits read off edge labels.
