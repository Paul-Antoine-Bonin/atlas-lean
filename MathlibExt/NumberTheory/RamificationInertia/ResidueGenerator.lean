# Residue generators

Let `B` be an `A`-algebra and `q` an ideal of `B`. If `B` is generated over `A`
by a single element `π ∈ q`, then the canonical map of residue algebras
`A ⧸ q.comap (algebraMap A B) → B ⧸ q` is surjective: writing an element of `B`
as a polynomial in `π`, only the constant coefficient survives in the quotient,
since `π` itself maps to zero.

## Main results

* `Ideal.quotient_algebraMap_surjective_of_adjoin_singleton_eq_top`: the
  canonical `A`-algebra map on residue algebras is surjective.
* `Ideal.inertiaDeg_eq_one_of_adjoin_singleton_eq_top`: the inertia degree
  is `1` under the same single-generator hypothesis.

/-- If `B` is generated over `A` by an element `π ∈ q`, then the canonical
`A`-algebra map `A ⧸ q.comap (algebraMap A B) → B ⧸ q` is surjective.

Indeed, lift a class to `b : B`, write `b` as `Polynomial.aeval π p`, and use
the constant coefficient `p.coeff 0`: all higher terms vanish in `B ⧸ q`
because `π` maps to zero. -/

/-- If `B` is generated over `A` by an element `π ∈ q`, then the inertia
degree of a maximal `q` over a maximal `q.under A` is `1`: the residue
algebras coincide via the surjective canonical map, so the extension has
finite rank one. -/
