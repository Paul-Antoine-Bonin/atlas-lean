/-! # Composing a Pell-type solution with a norm-one unit
-/

/--
Multiplying a solution `(T, U)` of `a * T ^ 2 - b * U ^ 2 = c` by a unit
`(x, y)` of `x ^ 2 - a * b * y ^ 2 = 1` yields the solution
`(T * x + b * U * y, a * T * y + U * x)`.

Lucas-Lehmer Primality Test," Journal of Integer Sequences 28 (2025),

The source iterates this step under the assumption that `ab > 1` is not a
square to obtain infinitely many solutions. That infinitude claim needs further
nondegeneracy hypotheses (for `T = U = c = 0` every iterate is `(0, 0)`) and is
not formalized here; the single-step identity is pure algebra
(multiplicativity of the norm form) needing no hypotheses beyond the two
equations.
