/-- An integer sequence is a Dold sequence when every finite positive prefix is
represented by traces of powers of an integer matrix of the same size.

This is the equivalent characterization in Lemma 3 of Wójcik's paper. The
ambient sequence is indexed from zero, but the defining equations begin at one,
as in the source.
