# Normalized theta error: measurability and global bound

## ATLAS source correspondence

This is one input stage for ATLAS NumberTheoryI N324, Theorem 16.13
(Newman's Tauberian theorem). At atlas-lean commit
`e8b31c5cb0bec89b487ce33fe525a2c0b0f8b9c6`, the exact source statement is
indexed in
[`v1/Atlas/NumberTheoryI/targets.yaml`, lines 2266--2272](https://github.com/facebookresearch/atlas-lean/blob/e8b31c5cb0bec89b487ce33fe525a2c0b0f8b9c6/v1/Atlas/NumberTheoryI/targets.yaml#L2266-L2272):
a bounded,
piecewise-continuous `f : ℝ≥0 → ℝ` whose Laplace transform extends
holomorphically to `0 ≤ re s` has a convergent improper integral equal to
the continuation at zero. Its Lean statement is
[`Chapter16.thm_16_13_newman_tauberian` in `v1/Atlas/NumberTheoryI/code/PNT.lean`,
lines 1061--1081](https://github.com/facebookresearch/atlas-lean/blob/e8b31c5cb0bec89b487ce33fe525a2c0b0f8b9c6/v1/Atlas/NumberTheoryI/code/PNT.lean#L1061-L1081);
the boundedness
hypothesis is represented there by
`∃ M, ∀ t : ℝ, 0 ≤ t → |f t| ≤ M`.

For the prime-number-theorem application, the same source
[defines `H(t) = θ(exp t) * exp(-t) - 1` and proves `H_bounded`, lines
1083--1103](https://github.com/facebookresearch/atlas-lean/blob/e8b31c5cb0bec89b487ce33fe525a2c0b0f8b9c6/v1/Atlas/NumberTheoryI/code/PNT.lean#L1083-L1103),
with the witness `M = log 4 + 1`. The declarations here map to
that concrete input as follows:

* `normalizedThetaError` (imported from the preceding N323 stage) is exactly
  the source function `H`.
* `measurable_normalizedThetaError` supplies the measurable regularity needed
  by Mathlib's Bochner/Laplace integration API. It does not assert the source's
  piecewise continuity hypothesis or the generic Newman theorem.
* `abs_normalizedThetaError_le` proves the source estimate using
  `0 ≤ θ(exp t) ≤ (log 4) exp t` and `exp t * exp(-t) = 1`. Its global
  quantifier is a harmless strengthening of this auxiliary estimate: restricting
  it to `0 ≤ t` gives exactly the hypothesis used by N324.
* `normalizedThetaError_bounded` packages the exact source-shaped hypothesis
  with `M = log 4 + 1`.

This PR establishes only measurability and boundedness for the concrete `H`.
It does not prove the
[contour argument (`PNT.lean`, lines 878--1060)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/atlas-lean/blob/e8b31c5cb0bec89b487ce33fe525a2c0b0f8b9c6/v1/Atlas/NumberTheoryI/code/PNT.lean#L878-L1060),
the generic N324 conclusion, convergence of `∫ H`, or the prime number theorem.
