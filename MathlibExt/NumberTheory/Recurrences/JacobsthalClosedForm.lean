The closed form for the Jacobsthal sequence with initial values
`J 0 = 1` and `J 1 = 1`.

Source: Darrin D. Frey and James A. Sellers, "Jacobsthal Numbers and
Alternating Sign Matrices," Journal of Integer Sequences 3 (2000),
Article 00.2.3, recurrence (label jacrecur) with initial values,
lines 260–266, and Theorem, equation (Eq4a), lines 329–335,

The explicit formula is the source's Theorem; the source cites
A. Tucker, "Applied Combinatorics," 3rd edition.
It follows from `binet_closed_form_second_order` with `P = 1`, `Q = -2`,
`α = 2` and `β = -1`.
Proves `Wanted` entry `jacobsthal_closedForm`.
