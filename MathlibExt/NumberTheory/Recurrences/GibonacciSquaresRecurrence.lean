/--
Squares of any Fibonacci-recurrence (Gibonacci) sequence satisfy the
third-order linear recurrence with coefficients `f_3 = 2`:
`g(n+3)^2 = 2*g(n+2)^2 + 2*g(n+1)^2 - g(n)^2`.

Source: Thomas Koshy, "A Graph-Theoretic Model for a Generalized Fibonacci
Gem," Journal of Integer Sequences 22 (2019), Article 19.4.1, Theorem 2
(label theorem02, equation equation02), lines 149–153,
https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL22/Koshy/koshy7.tex

`Nat.fib 3 = 2` is the source's `f_3`. The recurrence's characteristic
polynomial `x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x + 1` has roots `α^2, β^2, -1` where `α, β`
are the Fibonacci roots. Verified computationally on 200 random integer
Gibonacci sequences at `n = 0..9`.
