Pisano-period prime divisor bound for the generalized bi-periodic Fibonacci
sequence when the discriminant is nonzero, root-parameterized: `α` and `β` are
given roots with `α + β = A` and `α * β = c * d`, so `Δ = (α - β) ^ 2` is already
a square and no `IsSquare Δ` hypothesis is needed.
`generalizedBiPeriodicFibonacci_period_dvd` is the source-shaped form.

Pisano-period prime divisor bound for the generalized bi-periodic Fibonacci
sequence when the discriminant is a nonzero quadratic residue.

It follows from `generalizedBiPeriodicFibonacci_period_dvd_general`, which drops the
unused `IsSquare Δ`.
