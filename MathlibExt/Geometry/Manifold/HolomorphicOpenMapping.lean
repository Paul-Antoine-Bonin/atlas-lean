A nonconstant `MDiff` map between connected `1`-dimensional complex manifolds is an open map.
Source: O. Forster, Lectures on Riemann Surfaces, open mapping theorem for Riemann surfaces; Lean
states one-complex-dimensional specialization.
It is `MDifferentiable.isOpenMap_of_finrank_eq_one`, kept under the source's name.
Proves `Wanted` entry `holomorphic_open_mapping_one_dim`.
