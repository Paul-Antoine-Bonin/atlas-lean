/-- Intercept theorem (Thales) (intercept-s1): two transversals cut by parallel
lines, i.e. a triangle cut by a line parallel to one side: points `A`, `B`, `C`
with `D` on `AB` and `E` on `AC` with `DE` parallel to `BC` implies
`AD / DB = AE / EC`. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercept_theorem.
Proves `Wanted` entry `intercept_theorem`.
