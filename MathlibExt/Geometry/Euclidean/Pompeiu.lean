/-- Pompeiu's theorem for an arbitrary point: for an equilateral triangle `ABC` and any point
`P` in its plane, `PA`, `PB`, `PC` form the sides of a (possibly degenerate) triangle.
`pompeiu` is the source-shaped form. -/

/-- Pompeiu's theorem (statement_id `pompeiu-s1`): an equilateral triangle `ABC` and a point
`P` in its plane not coinciding with a vertex satisfy that `PA`, `PB`, `PC` form the sides
of a (possibly degenerate) triangle. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeiu%27s_theorem.
It follows from `pompeiu_general`; the vertex exclusion `hP` is unused (the source allows any
point `P`) and keeps the `Wanted` statement's shape.
Proves `Wanted` entry `pompeiu`.
