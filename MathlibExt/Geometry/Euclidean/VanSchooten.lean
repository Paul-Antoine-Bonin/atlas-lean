/-- Van Schooten's theorem without point-disequality hypotheses: if `ABC` is equilateral,
inscribed in the circle of radius `r > 0` about `O`, and `P` on that circle is strictly closer
to `A` and to `B` than to `C`, then `PA + PB = PC`. `vanSchooten` is the source-shaped form. -/

/-- Van Schooten's theorem: an equilateral triangle `ABC` with a point `P` on the
circumcircle on arc `AB` not containing `C` satisfies `PA + PB = PC`.
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Schooten%27s_theorem.
It follows from `vanSchooten_general`; the hypotheses `P ≠ A`, `P ≠ B` and `P ≠ C` are unused
and keep the source's shape.
Proves `Wanted` entry `vanSchooten`.
