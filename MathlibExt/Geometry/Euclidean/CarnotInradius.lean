/-- Carnot's theorem (inradius, circumradius), general form: for a nondegenerate triangle with
    circumcenter `O`, circumradius `R`, incenter `I`, and inradius `r`, the signed
    distances `x`, `y`, `z` from `O` to the three sidelines (each measured with an
    inward unit normal, hence positive toward the opposite vertex) satisfy
    `x + y + z = R + r`.
    Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot%27s_theorem_(inradius,_circumradius).
    Statement ID: carnot-inradius-s1.

Unlike `carnot_inradius_circumradius`, this drops the hypotheses `O ∈ affineSpan ℝ {A, B, C}`
    and `0 < r`, which the proof never needs.

/-- Carnot's theorem (inradius, circumradius): for a nondegenerate triangle with
    circumcenter `O`, circumradius `R`, incenter `I`, and inradius `r`, the signed
    distances `x`, `y`, `z` from `O` to the three sidelines (each measured with an
    inward unit normal, hence positive toward the opposite vertex) satisfy
    `x + y + z = R + r`.
    Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot%27s_theorem_(inradius,_circumradius).
    Statement ID: carnot-inradius-s1.

It follows from `carnot_inradius_circumradius_general`; the hypotheses `hOplane` and `hrpos`
    are unused and keep the `Wanted` statement's shape.
Proves `Wanted` entry `carnot_inradius_circumradius`.
