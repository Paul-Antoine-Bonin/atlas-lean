/-- Varignon's theorem (statement varignon-s1): side-midpoints of any quadrilateral form
a parallelogram of half the area.
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varignon%27s_theorem.
`A B C D` are arbitrary points in the Euclidean plane, including degenerate or
self-crossing configurations.
`P Q R S` are the midpoints of sides AB, BC, CD, DA (`2 • P = A + B`, etc.).
Conclusion: `P + R = Q + S` (the diagonals of PQRS bisect each other, i.e. PQRS is a
parallelogram via parallel opposite sides / bisecting diagonals), and twice the signed area of
PQRS, expressed through `EuclideanGeometry.orientedTriangleArea`, equals the signed area of ABCD.

Proves `Wanted` entry `varignon`.
