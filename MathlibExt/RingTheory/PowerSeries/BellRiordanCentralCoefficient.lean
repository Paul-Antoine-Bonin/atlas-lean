Central coefficients of Bell-subgroup Riordan matrices: for the Bell matrix
`(g(X), X*g(X))`, the entry in row `2*n` and column `n` equals `(n+1)`
times the degree-`(n+1)` coefficient of the compositional inverse `u` of
`X / g(X)`.

Source: Paul Barry, "On the Central Coefficients of Bell Matrices,"
Journal of Integer Sequences 14 (2011), Article 11.4.3, Theorem `laterthm`,
lines 167-169, <https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL14/Barry3/barry132.tex>.

The paper's `[x^n] (1/x) u(x)` is rendered as `coeff (n+1) u`, and
`T_{2n,n} = [x^{2n}] g*(X*g)^n` follows the paper's proof.

Proves `Wanted` entry `bell_riordan_central_coefficient`; it is now a proved
theorem, obtained by specializing the Lagrange–Bürmann coefficient formula
`fps_lagrange_burmann_coeff'`.
