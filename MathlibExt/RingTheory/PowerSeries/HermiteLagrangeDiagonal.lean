/-- Hermite's distinct diagonal/reversion form: the `n`-th coefficient of
`F * phi ^ n` equals the `n`-th coefficient of the diagonal generating series `G`, where `w` is
the reverted series (`w = X * phi(w)`) and `(1 - X * phi'(w)) * G = F(w)`.

This contrasts with the derivative-coefficient form in
`WantedExt/RingTheory/PowerSeries/LagrangeBurmannCoefficientWanted.lean`, which
extracts the coefficient via an explicit derivative factor; here the derivative
is instead absorbed into the defining equation for `G`. No definitions are
duplicated.
