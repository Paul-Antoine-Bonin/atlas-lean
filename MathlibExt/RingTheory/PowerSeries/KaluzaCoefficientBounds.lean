# Kaluza's bounds for the coefficients of a reciprocal power series

If a real formal power series `f` has strictly positive log-convex coefficients `aₙ`, then the
coefficients `bₙ` of `f⁻¹` satisfy `b₀ = a₀⁻¹ > 0` and `-aₙ / a₀² ≤ bₙ ≤ 0` for `n ≥ 1`.

nonpositivity of `bₙ` to T. Kaluza, Satz 3.

/-- Positive log-convex coefficients hypothesis for Kaluza's inverse-coefficient
bounds: every coefficient of `f` is strictly positive and

/-- Combined Kaluza inverse-coefficient bounds: under
`HasPositiveLogConvexCoefficients f`, the formal reciprocal `f⁻¹` satisfies
`b₀ = a₀⁻¹` with `b₀ > 0`, and for every `n ≥ 1`,
`-aₙ / a₀² ≤ bₙ ≤ 0`, where `aₙ` and `bₙ` are the coefficients of `f`
and of the formal power-series reciprocal `f⁻¹`. This is a formal reciprocal
with no analytic convergence assumptions.
