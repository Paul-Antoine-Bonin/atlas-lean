/-- Taylor's formula for formal power series: the exponential generating series of the
successive derivatives of `f` is `f(t + u)`.

This is equation (5.32) in Emanuele Munarini, *Combinatorial Identities for the Tricomi
Polynomials*, Journal of Integer Sequences 23 (2020), Article 20.9.4. The variables `t` and `u`
are represented by `MvPowerSeries.X 0` and `MvPowerSeries.X 1`. -/
