# Ideal multiplicity is unchanged under localization at a maximal ideal

For a Dedekind domain `R` and a maximal ideal `p`, the exponent of `p` in an
ideal `I` (as recorded by `emultiplicity`) agrees with the exponent of the
maximal ideal of any localization `Rₚ` at `p` in the mapped ideal `I.map`.

This invariant is the first corrected prerequisite for ATLAS `NumberTheoryI`
N261: the helper `different_valuation_exact` (claiming
`d_P = e_P - 1 + v_P(e_P)`) is false in wildly ramified extensions, so N261
will formalize only the true two-sided bound. Transporting valuations of
`differentIdeal A B` and of the correction term `Ideal.span {(e : B)}` to the
localization at a prime is the step that makes the local computation available.

## Main result

- `IsLocalization.AtPrime.emultiplicity_maximalIdeal_map_eq`: the exponent of
  an ideal at a maximal ideal equals the exponent of its image at the maximal
  ideal of the localization.
