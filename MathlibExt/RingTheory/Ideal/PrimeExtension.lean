# Primality of extended ideals under denominator clearing

Let `O → B` be an injective algebra map of commutative rings, `p : Ideal O` a prime
ideal, and `c : Ideal O` such that every `x ∈ c` clears denominators uniformly
(`algebraMap O B x * b` is in the range of `algebraMap O B` for all `b : B`) and
`c ⊔ p = ⊤`. Then the extended ideal `p.map (algebraMap O B)` is prime in `B`.

The comaximality hypothesis yields an element `y ∈ c` with a decomposition
`y + z = 1`, `z ∈ p`; since `p` is proper, `y ∉ p`, so in particular `¬ c ≤ p` is
derived rather than assumed. The canonical quotient map `O ⧸ p → B ⧸ p.map f` is
then an isomorphism: surjectivity clears the denominator of a representative using
`y`, and injectivity clears the finitely many denominators in a span representation
of an element of `p.map f`, reducing to primality of `p`. Transport of `IsDomain`
(resp. `IsField`) across this isomorphism gives primality (resp. maximality) of the
extended ideal. No Dedekind-domain hypotheses are used.

/-- Bijectivity of the canonical quotient map under denominator clearing.

Under the hypotheses of `Ideal.isPrime_map_of_coprime_clearDenom`, the canonical
map `O ⧸ p → B ⧸ p.map (algebraMap O B)` is bijective. This bundles the injective
and surjective parts so the primality and maximality corollaries share one proof. -/

/-- Primality of the extended ideal under denominator clearing.

If `algebraMap O B` is injective, `p` is prime, every `x ∈ c` clears denominators
uniformly, and `c ⊔ p = ⊤`, then `p.map (algebraMap O B)` is prime. The proof
builds the quotient isomorphism `O ⧸ p ≃+* B ⧸ p.map (algebraMap O B)` and
transports `IsDomain` across it. -/

a maximal ideal: the quotient isomorphism transports `IsField`. -/

to a maximal ideal under the same clearing and comaximality hypotheses.

This is the `Ring.DimensionLEOne` form of maximality of the mapped prime; it adds
no silent assumptions beyond the dimension bound and `p ≠ ⊥`. -/
