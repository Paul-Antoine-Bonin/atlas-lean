# Invariance of multigraded Betti numbers across graded free resolutions

This file proves that, given two multigraded free resolutions of the same
target with certified base-change data each, a multidegreewise
chain-homotopy equivalence between their component complexes forces their
`multigradedBettiNumber` values to agree at every multidegree and
homological index.

`https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL23/Braun/braun4.tex`,
exact lines 866--874. Those lines define `β^R_(i,α)(M)` as the vector-space
dimension of the `i`th homology of the degree-`α` component of `K ⊗ F` for a
graded free resolution `F` of `M`, writing the Betti number without naming a
resolution. Edge 4 removed only the component-presentation choice inside one
fixed resolution; this edge removes the resolution choice once an explicit
degree-preserving comparison is supplied.

The comparison hypothesis is the whole point and is stated conspicuously:
nothing here proves existence of a degree-preserving comparison for every
pair of resolutions, its uniqueness, minimality of either resolution, finite
support, Poincaré polynomiality or rationality, or Hilbert syzygy. Mathlib's
ungraded projective-resolution comparison is not shown to preserve the
multigrading, so unconditional independence would hide an unproved grading
obligation; the `MultigradedResolutionComparison` interface isolates exactly
that obligation.

Main definitions and results:

* `MetaMathlibExt.MultigradedResolutionComparison`: for every multidegree
  `α`, a chain-homotopy equivalence between the two certified degree-`α`
  component complexes.
* `MetaMathlibExt.multigradedBettiNumber_eq_of_resolutionComparison`: such a
  comparison implies equal `multigradedBettiNumber` values for every `α`
  and `i`.

/-- Comparison data between two multigraded free resolutions of the same
target: for every multidegree `α`, a chain-homotopy equivalence between the
certified degree-`α` component complexes.

A homotopy equivalence, rather than a bare quasi-isomorphism, is the
comparison-theorem input: Mathlib derives the homology isomorphism from it.
Existence and uniqueness of such a comparison are not claimed here. -/
