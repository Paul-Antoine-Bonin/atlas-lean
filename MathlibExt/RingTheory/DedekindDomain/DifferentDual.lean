# Different-dual order bridge

This module records the order-theoretic bridge between the different ideal and
the dual fractional ideal: an integral ideal lies below the different if and
only if its product with the dual of `1` lies below `1`.

## Source correspondence

The motivating source statement is Andrew V. Sutherland, *18.785 Number Theory I*,
Lecture 12,
[Theorem 12.27](https://math.mit.edu/classes/18.785/2021fa/LectureNotes12.pdf#page=10).
In the AKLB setting it bounds the valuation of the different
`D_{B/A}` at a prime `q` and characterizes equality in the tame case.  This module does
not claim those valuation bounds; it isolates the ideal-containment bridge needed for the
upper-bound route.

Here `FractionalIdeal.dual A K (1 : FractionalIdeal B⁰ L)` is the trace dual
`Bᵛ = {x ∈ L | Tr_{L/K}(xB) ⊆ A}`, and Mathlib's
`coeIdeal_differentIdeal` identifies the fractional ideal underlying
`differentIdeal A B` with `(Bᵛ)⁻¹`.  After coercing an integral ideal `I` to a
fractional ideal, the theorem is the order identity
`I ⊆ (Bᵛ)⁻¹ ⇔ I Bᵛ ⊆ B`; the right-hand `1` denotes the unit
fractional ideal `B`.

The typeclass assumptions reproduce AKLB: `A` is an integrally closed domain with
fraction field `K`; `L/K` is finite separable; and `B` is the Dedekind integral closure
of `A` in `L`, with fraction field `L`.  The scalar-tower and torsion-free instances
supply the compatible embeddings used by Mathlib's trace-dual and different APIs.
