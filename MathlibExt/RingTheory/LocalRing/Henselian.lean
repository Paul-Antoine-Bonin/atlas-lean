# Henselianity from maximal-adic completeness

A local ring that is complete for its maximal-ideal adic topology satisfies
Hensel's lemma, hence is a Henselian local ring.

Source map: prerequisite for ATLAS NumberTheoryI item N211, Theorem 10.13
(Section 10.2), at atlas-lean revision
`e8b31c5cb0bec89b487ce33fe525a2c0b0f8b9c6`, whose
[English target is N211 / Theorem 10.13, lines 1466-1483](https://github.com/facebookresearch/atlas-lean/blob/e8b31c5cb0bec89b487ce33fe525a2c0b0f8b9c6/v1/Atlas/NumberTheoryI/targets.yaml#L1466-L1483).
That target assumes a complete DVR
and builds the equivalence for unramified extensions.

The implementation source is
[`v1/Atlas/NumberTheoryI/code/ResidueFieldFunctor.lean`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/atlas-lean/blob/e8b31c5cb0bec89b487ce33fe525a2c0b0f8b9c6/v1/Atlas/NumberTheoryI/code/ResidueFieldFunctor.lean):
[`dvr_extension_henselian` (lines 988-999)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/atlas-lean/blob/e8b31c5cb0bec89b487ce33fe525a2c0b0f8b9c6/v1/Atlas/NumberTheoryI/code/ResidueFieldFunctor.lean#L988-L999)
turns maximal-ideal-adic completeness
of an extension DVR into `HenselianLocalRing` by invoking Mathlib's
`IsAdicComplete.henselianRing` and mapping the derivative-unit condition through
the residue quotient. `residueFieldFunctor_full_faithfulness` uses that instance
at [line 1019](https://github.com/facebookresearch/atlas-lean/blob/e8b31c5cb0bec89b487ce33fe525a2c0b0f8b9c6/v1/Atlas/NumberTheoryI/code/ResidueFieldFunctor.lean#L1019)
before its Hensel-lifting argument.
[`residueFieldFunctor_isEquivalence` (lines 1320-1338)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/atlas-lean/blob/e8b31c5cb0bec89b487ce33fe525a2c0b0f8b9c6/v1/Atlas/NumberTheoryI/code/ResidueFieldFunctor.lean#L1320-L1338)
is the eventual N211 package.

`HenselianLocalRing.of_isAdicComplete_maximalIdeal` corresponds to
`dvr_extension_henselian` and supplies the Henselian instance used by the later
fullness/equivalence stages.

The reusable theorem intentionally generalizes the source helper: it requires only
`CommRing R`, `IsLocalRing R`, and maximal-ideal-adic completeness. It removes
the source helper's `IsDomain` and `IsDiscreteValuationRing` assumptions, retaining
their needed `IsLocalRing` consequence, and extracts the result from its
extension-specific context because neither `IsAdicComplete.henselianRing` nor
the quotient-unit conversion uses them.

The conclusion is exactly `HenselianLocalRing R`; the proof maps the derivative's
unit property into the residue quotient before applying the Mathlib Hensel theorem.

This is only a prerequisite stage, not the full N211 theorem: it does not construct
residue-field morphisms, prove full faithfulness or essential surjectivity, lift
equivalences, or establish a category equivalence.
