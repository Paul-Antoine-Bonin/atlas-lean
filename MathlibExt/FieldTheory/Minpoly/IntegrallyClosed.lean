# Integrality over an integrally closed domain via minimal polynomials

For an integrally closed domain `R` with fraction field `K` and a field extension `L`
of `K`, an element of `L` algebraic over `K` is integral over `R` if and only if its
`K`-minimal polynomial lifts to `R`, equivalently every coefficient lies in the range
of `algebraMap R K`.
