/--
Riordan characterization of coefficient arrays of monic orthogonal polynomials:
for a Riordan array `L = (d, h)`, being the coefficient array of a family of
monic orthogonal polynomials is equivalent to each of: the Meixner-type
`(d, h)`-form with nonzero recurrence subdiagonal; the Stieltjes
production-matrix form of the inverse array with the monic normalization
`L 0 0 = 1`; and the coefficient recurrence form with the same nondegeneracy
condition.

Source: Paul Barry and Aoife Hennessy, "Meixner-Type Results for Riordan Arrays
and Associated Integer Sequences," Journal of Integer Sequences 13 (2010),
Article 10.9.4, Proposition (referee's summary of the main results),
lines 733–752,
https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL13/Barry5/barry96s.tex

Proves `Wanted` entry `riordan_coeff_orth_equiv`.

Proof: The coefficient recurrence is the common hub. The Meixner equivalence follows from
Barry-Hennessy, the orthogonality equivalence from Favard's theorem as in Chihara, and the
inverse-array equivalence from the `linvOf` Stieltjes production construction.
