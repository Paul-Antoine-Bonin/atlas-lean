/-- Moment generating function as a J-fraction, assuming only what the argument uses: if `p`
satisfies the three-term recurrence with coefficients `α` and `β`, `μ k = L (X ^ k)`, and
`L (p n) = 0` for `n ≥ 1`, then the moments have a Jacobi fraction
`HasJacobiFraction μ α β (μ 0) S` whose tails `S n` have constant coefficient one.
`moment_generating_function_as_J_fraction` is the source-shaped form. -/

Moment generating function as J-fraction for monic orthogonal polynomials:
Favard three-term recurrence implies the moment power series equals the
coefficientwise infinite J-fraction limit.

Source: Paul Barry and Aoife Hennessy, "Meixner-Type Results for Riordan
Arrays and Associated Integer Sequences," Journal of Integer Sequences 13
(2010), Article 10.9.4, J-fraction theorem citing C. Krattenthaler (cf.
Viennot Proposition 1, (7), p. V-5; Wall Theorem 51.1), lines 353–362,
https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL13/Barry5/barry96s.tex

The source's recurrence line reads `beta_n(x)`; it is rendered as
`beta_n p_{n-1}` per the surrounding lines 315–317 and 364–366.
It follows from `moment_generating_function_as_J_fraction_general`; the monicity and degree,
`β n ≠ 0`, nonzero-norm and `μ 0 ≠ 0` hypotheses are unused and keep the source's shape, and
orthogonality is used only to get `L (p n) = 0` for `n ≥ 1`.
Proves `Wanted` entry `moment_generating_function_as_J_fraction`.
