# Permutation stability of groups

Normalized and flexible Hamming distances between permutations, almost-homomorphisms,
and (flexible) permutation stability, following Kourovka Notebook 21.84.

namespace PermutationStability

/-- Normalized Hamming distance between two permutations of `Fin n`: the
fraction of points on which they disagree. At `n = 0` the denominator is zero,
so the quotient is `0` by the `ZeroInv₀` convention; this single value is
harmless for `Filter.atTop` convergence statements. -/
noncomputable def normalizedHammingDistance (n : ℕ) (σ τ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) : ℝ :=
  (hammingDist (fun i => σ i) (fun i => τ i) : ℝ) / n

/-- A sequence of (arbitrary) set maps `f n : G → Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` is an
almost-homomorphism when the normalized Hamming defect
`d(f n g * f n h, f n (g * h))` tends to zero for every pair `g h`.
Following the source, no condition such as `f n 1 = 1` is imposed. -/

  ∀ g h : G, Filter.Tendsto
    (fun n => normalizedHammingDistance n (f n g * f n h) (f n (g * h)))
    Filter.atTop (nhds 0)

/-- `f` is close to homomorphisms when genuine homomorphisms
`ρ n : G →* Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` pointwise approximate it in normalized
Hamming distance, uniformly over each fixed `g` along `Filter.atTop`. -/

    (f : ∀ n : ℕ, G → Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) : Prop :=

genuine homomorphisms. -/

  ∀ f : ∀ n : ℕ, G → Equiv.Perm (Fin n),
    IsAlmostHomomorphism f → IsCloseToHomomorphisms f

/-- Flexible Hamming distance between a small permutation `σ` of `Fin n` and a
large permutation `τ` of `Fin m` (with `h : n ≤ m`): the disagreement count on
the embedded copy plus the `m - n` unmatched points, normalized by `n`.

Kourovka 21.84 is internally inconsistent about the argument order: it first
defines the distance with the small permutation first, `d_n^flex(σ, τ)` for
`σ ∈ S_n`, `τ ∈ S_m`, but later writes the convergence expression with
`ρ_n(g)` first. This formalization follows the definition site (small first),
which is also the type-correct order for the embedding `Fin n → Fin m`.

As above, the `n = 0` denominator is harmless for `Filter.atTop`
convergence. -/

  ((hammingDist (fun i => Fin.castLE h (σ i))
      (fun i => τ (Fin.castLE h i)) + (m - n) : ℕ) : ℝ) / n

/-- `f` is flexibly close to homomorphisms when, after embedding each `Fin n`
into some `Fin (m n)`, genuine homomorphisms `ρ n` approximate `f` in the
flexible Hamming distance for every fixed `g` along `Filter.atTop`. -/
