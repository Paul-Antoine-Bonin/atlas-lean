# Generic Hamming expansion and ball predicates

ATLAS item N134 (ProbabilisticMethodsInCombinatorics:134). Reusable generic
support extracted while reformalizing that item. Source:
`Atlas/ProbabilisticMethodsInCombinatorics/code/Chapter9/HarperIsoperimetric.lean`
(lines 17--39) at commit `e8b31c5cb0bec89b487ce33fe525a2c0b0f8b9c6`:
<https://github.com/facebookresearch/atlas-lean/blob/e8b31c5cb0bec89b487ce33fe525a2c0b0f8b9c6/v1/Atlas/ProbabilisticMethodsInCombinatorics/code/Chapter9/HarperIsoperimetric.lean#L17-L39>

Source-to-API map: ATLAS's duplicate Hamming distance and ball map to
existing `hammingDist` and `Hamming.ball`, while ATLAS's expansion operator and ball
predicate map to `Hamming.expansion` and `Hamming.IsBall`.

This module is a supporting step, not the full N134 target; the Wanted module
states the full ball-comparison target. The Harper theorem itself is not
proved here.
