# Logarithmic integral (normalized principal value)

Classical lowercase logarithmic integral `li(x) := ∫₀ˣ dt / log t` in the
normalization used by arXiv:2306.14073v1 and arXiv:2309.16007v1. The real-valued
interpretation is the Cauchy principal value at the non-integrable singularity
`t = 1`. The function is defined on `{x : ℝ // 0 ≤ x ∧ x ≠ 1}`; the point
`x = 1` is excluded because `1 / log t` has a non-integrable singularity
there. At `x = 0` the value is `0`, as the integral over a degenerate interval
vanishes. For `x > 1` the principal value is represented by the paired form
symmetric about `1`, not by the raw interval integral `∫₀ˣ`, which Mathlib
totalizes via `inv 0 = 0` and Lebesgue measure-zero modifications at isolated
points. The paired symmetric integral is Lebesgue-equivalent to
`lim_{ε → 0⁺} (∫₀^{1-ε} + ∫_{1+ε}²)`.

/-- Domain of the normalized logarithmic integral: `0 ≤ x` and `x ≠ 1`.

`1` is excluded because `1 / log t` is singular at `t = 1`; the classical
integral `∫₀ˣ dt / log t` has no finite real value at `x = 1` and is
understood as a Cauchy principal value for `x ≠ 1`.

/-- Normalized Cauchy-principal-value logarithmic integral `li`.

For `0 ≤ x < 1`, `li x = ∫ t in 0..x, (log t)⁻¹`. For `x > 1`,
`li x = (∫ u in 0..1, ((log (1 - u))⁻¹ + (log (1 + u))⁻¹)) +
        ∫ t in 2..x, (log t)⁻¹`,
where the first integral is the paired symmetric principal value
`PV ∫₀² dt / log t = ∫₀¹ ((log (1-u))⁻¹ + (log (1+u))⁻¹) du` obtained
by `t = 1 ∓ u`. The value at `0` is `0`. The function is not defined at
`1` because the integrand is singular there. Single-point totalizations
`(log 1)⁻¹ = 0` and `(log 0)⁻¹ = 0` do not affect Lebesgue interval
integrals.
