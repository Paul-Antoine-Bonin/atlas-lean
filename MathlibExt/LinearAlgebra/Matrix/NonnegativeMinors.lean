/-- A rectangular real matrix has nonnegative minors when every finite square
submatrix selected by strictly increasing row and column maps has nonnegative
determinant. The quantification over all `k : ℕ` includes the `0 × 0` minor
(`k = 0`).

This rectangular-indexed predicate is named for its defining property rather
than as a second spelling of Mathlib's square-matrix total-nonnegativity API.
