/-- Common-difference progressions: holds exactly when there is one shared
`d : G` such that `A` and `B` are both set-level arithmetic progressions of
their own cardinalities with difference `d`, stated directly with
`Set.IsAPOfLengthWith`; the two progressions may have different initial
terms and different cardinalities.
