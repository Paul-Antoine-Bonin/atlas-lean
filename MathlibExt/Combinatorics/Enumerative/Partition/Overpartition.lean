# Overpartitions

An overpartition of `n` is a partition of `n` in which the first (equivalently, last)
occurrence of each distinct part may be overlined. Since `Nat.Partition` stores an
unordered multiset, the overlining data are represented by a choice of distinct part
sizes occurring in the underlying partition. The two conventions are equivalent: each
records one binary choice per distinct occurring part size, and the unordered multiset
carries no order to distinguish first from last.

## Main definitions

* `Nat.Overpartition` is an overpartition with a specified underlying partition and overlined sizes.
* `Nat.Overpartition.IsOverlined` says that a part size is overlined.
* `Nat.Overpartition.ofPartition` equips a partition with no overlined sizes.
* `Nat.Overpartition.full` equips a partition with every distinct part size overlined.
