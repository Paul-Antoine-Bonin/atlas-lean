# Rising diagonals of binary binomial interpolated triangles

Source: L. Németh, *On the binomial interpolated triangles*, Journal of Integer
Sequences 20 (2017), Article 17.7.2,
[`nemeth2.tex`](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL20/Nemeth/nemeth2.tex).

The Case 1 triangle `BT(a₀,a₁,α,β;α,β)` is fixed by the column-zero recurrence
and the interior recurrence below. Its corollary (source lines 760–865) states
that every rising diagonal of this triangle is constant.
