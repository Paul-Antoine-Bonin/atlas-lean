/-- Raney's cycle lemma in the sum-minus-one form: for a finite list `a : List Int`
with every entry at least `-1` and total sum `-1`, there exists exactly one rotation
index whose proper prefixes all have nonnegative sum. Lean's zero-based left rotation
is a bijective reindexing of the source's cut after `a_r`; `t < a.length` ranges over
every proper prefix, with `t = 0` giving the true empty-prefix condition.
