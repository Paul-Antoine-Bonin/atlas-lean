/-- A word is an overlap if it has the form `x y x y x` for a nonempty word `x`.

Allowing `x` to have arbitrary positive length is essential: restricting it to one letter
does not faithfully state the source definition. -/

  ∃ x y : List α, x ≠ [] ∧ o = x ++ y ++ x ++ y ++ x

/-- A finite binary word is overlap-free when none of its contiguous factors is an overlap. -/

  ∀ o : List Bool, o.IsInfix w → ¬ IsWordOverlap o
