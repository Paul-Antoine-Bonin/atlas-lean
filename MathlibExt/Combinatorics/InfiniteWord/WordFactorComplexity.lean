/-- Factor complexity of an infinite word `w` over a finite alphabet:
the complexity function `p_w(n)`, the number of distinct contiguous factors
of `w` of length `n`, where a length-`n` factor starting at `i` is
`fun j : Fin n => w (i + j)`. The image set collapses repeated occurrences,
so `Set.ncard` of the range counts distinct factors rather than occurrences.
