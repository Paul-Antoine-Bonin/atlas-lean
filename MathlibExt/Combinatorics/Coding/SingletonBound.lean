/-- A `q`-ary block code of length `n` and minimum distance at least `d` has at
most `q ^ (n - d + 1)` codewords.

This is the Singleton bound. The proof punctures the code to its first
`n - d + 1` coordinates: two codewords agreeing on all retained coordinates
can differ in at most the `d - 1` deleted coordinates, contradicting the
minimum-distance hypothesis, so puncturing is injective on the code and the
bound follows by counting the punctured words.
