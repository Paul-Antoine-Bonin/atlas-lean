/-- Bundled finite simple graph: a vertex type together with its finiteness
witness and a simple graph on it. The witness is an instance-implicit field,
so it is synthesized by typeclass search at construction; downstream code
still accesses it explicitly as `G.fin`, since instances cannot depend on a
locally bound graph.

structure FinGraph where
  V : Type*
  [fin : Finite V]
  G : SimpleGraph V

/-- Single-step minor operation: `iso` is relabelling up to graph isomorphism;
`deleteVertex` is deletion of exactly one vertex (induced subgraph missing the
image of one vertex); `deleteEdge` is deletion of exactly one edge (vertices
identified up to an equivalence, edge sets agree except for one distinguished
edge); `contractEdge` collapses exactly one adjacent pair (a surjective map
identifying a single adjacent pair `a, b` and injective otherwise, with
adjacency in `H` given by images of adjacent pairs in `G` at distinct vertices,
so no loop is forced at the identified vertex).
