/-- Finite binary word over the fixed alphabet `Sigma = {a, b}`, represented
canonically as `List (Fin 2)` with `0` and `1` the two letters. A word `u` is
equilibrious iff it contains equal numbers of `0`s and `1`s, counted with
`List.count`. Provenance: concept `jis_sem_061cc96760fa3a6b576dda00`,
source <https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL28/Coons/coons6.tex>, lines 543–575,

/-- Decidability of the equilibrious-word predicate, by decidable equality on
the two `List.count` values. Exposed so `by decide` works across the module
boundary. Provenance: concept `jis_sem_061cc96760fa3a6b576dda00`, source

/-- Reversal invariance: a finite binary word is equilibrious iff its reversal
is. Elementary reusable consequence of the `List.count` definition.
