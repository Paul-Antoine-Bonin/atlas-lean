# Cubic surfaces in ℙ³

A *cubic surface* is a degree-`3` hypersurface in projective `3`-space `ℙ³` over a field `k`.
Following the same hypersurface pattern used for higher-dimensional cubics (a cubic fourfold is
a degree-`3` hypersurface in `ℙ⁵`, and so on), we present such a surface by its **defining
equation**: a nonzero homogeneous polynomial of degree `3` in the four homogeneous coordinates
`x₀, x₁, x₂, x₃`. The surface itself is the projective zero locus `V(f) ⊆ ℙ³`.

Clause-by-clause mapping from the informal notion to `AlgebraicGeometry.CubicSurface`:

* "cubic form in the four coordinates of `ℙ³`" ↦ `defining : MvPolynomial (Fin 4) k`;
* "of degree `3`" ↦ `defining.IsHomogeneous 3`;
* "cuts out an honest hypersurface (the equation is not identically zero)" ↦ `defining ≠ 0`.
  The zero polynomial is vacuously homogeneous of every degree, so this last clause is what pins
  the degree to exactly `3` (see `CubicSurface.totalDegree_defining`).

## Main definitions

* `AlgebraicGeometry.CubicSurface`: a cubic surface in `ℙ³` over `k`, i.e. its defining cubic form.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.CubicSurface.IsSingularPoint`: a singular point of the affine cone.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.CubicSurface.IsSmooth`: the Jacobian smoothness criterion.

## Implementation notes

The scheme `Proj (k[x₀,x₁,x₂,x₃] / (f))` is not constructible from the Mathlib API at this pin
(there is no graded-ring structure on the quotient by a homogeneous ideal), so scheme-level
smoothness is unavailable. Instead we record the classical **Jacobian criterion**:
`CubicSurface.IsSmooth` asks that the only common zero of the defining cubic and all of its
partial derivatives is the coordinate origin. This is exactly nonsingularity of the projective
surface `V(f)` over an algebraically closed field, so `IsSmooth` is only defined under an
`[IsAlgClosed k]` hypothesis; over a general field, smoothness must be checked after base
change to `AlgebraicClosure k` (checking `k`-rational points alone is strictly weaker). By Euler's identity, when `3` is invertible in
`k` the condition `f = 0` is redundant given that all partials vanish
(`CubicSurface.isSingularPoint_iff`). The definition is built purely by composing existing
Mathlib API (`MvPolynomial.IsHomogeneous`, `MvPolynomial.pderiv`, `MvPolynomial.aeval`) rather
than introducing any new primitive.
