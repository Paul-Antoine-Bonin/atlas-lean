# Topological 3-manifolds

A **topological 3-manifold** is a topological space that is locally homeomorphic to `ℝ³`,
Hausdorff, and second-countable.  In Mathlib, "locally homeomorphic to `ℝ³`" is exactly a
`ChartedSpace (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)) M` instance, so `IsThreeManifold` is a thin predicate
over the `ChartedSpace` API bundling the two remaining point-set conditions.

We also provide the manifold-with-boundary variant `IsThreeManifoldWithBoundary`, modelled on the
Euclidean half-space `EuclideanHalfSpace 2`.

## Main definitions

* `IsThreeManifold M`: `M` is a (boundaryless) topological 3-manifold.
* `IsThreeManifoldWithBoundary M`: `M` is a topological 3-manifold with boundary.

## References

* John M. Lee, *Introduction to Topological Manifolds*, definition of a topological manifold.
