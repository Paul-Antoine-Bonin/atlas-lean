# Additivity of projective resolutions and left-derived functors

The functor `projectiveResolutions C`, sending an object to (a choice of) its
projective resolution in the homotopy category, is additive. As a consequence,
the left-derived functors `F.leftDerived n` of an additive functor `F` are
additive.
