# The real `list_sort_impl` policy trace replays

This module connects the chronological `.formed`/`.merge` observations made
by the genuine traced evaluator to the pure checked replay in
`MergePolicyReplay`.  The bridge is deliberately comparator-agnostic: it uses
the pending-layout and storage hypotheses already discharged by the public
safety theorem, but assumes no order law.

/-! ## Top-level empty/singleton normalization -/

/-- Paper-facing formed-run lengths for a real top-level execution.

Inputs of length zero and one bypass the scan, so their genuine policy-event
stream is empty.  The singleton leaf is introduced only at this semantic
normalization boundary; no synthetic `.formed` observation is added to the
machine trace. -/

/-- Normalize the real top-level policy stream to an empty-or-tree merge plan.

For the two scan-bypass cases the empty event stream means `.empty` at length
zero and one literal leaf at length one.  Larger inputs use the checked replay
without alteration. -/
