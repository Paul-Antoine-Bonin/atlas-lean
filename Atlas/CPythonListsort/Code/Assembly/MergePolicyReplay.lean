# Checked replay of the interleaved PowerSort policy trace

The access trace records formed-run pushes and logical, pre-trimming merges in
one chronological channel.  This module gives that raw channel a deliberately
strict, pure semantics.  A formed-run observation is accepted only when its
post-push depth, source interval, adaptive-minrun branch, and remaining-input
metadata agree.  A merge is accepted only when its index and full source
spans identify an adjacent pair in the current forest.

Every replayed internal node is labelled by the transcribed `powerloop`
applied to the aggregate spans being merged.  No label supplied by the trace
is trusted, and physical trimming does not alter the logical merge cost.
