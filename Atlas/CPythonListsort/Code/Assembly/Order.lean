# Order, sortedness, and occurrence-level stability specifications

The sorting implementation accepts a total Boolean comparator.  Correctness
adds a strict-weak-order hypothesis only at the theorem boundary.  Stability
is phrased over occurrence tags that are attached to the input before any
movement; the output cannot be retagged after sorting.
