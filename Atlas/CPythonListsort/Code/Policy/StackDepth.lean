# Pending-stack depth bound

The powers stored before the caller's unconditional push are distinct members
of the concrete interval `1 .. 60`.  A finite pigeonhole argument therefore
bounds the current stack by `60`; the unbounded modeled push has depth exactly
one larger and remains strictly below CPython's 64-entry pending array.

Nothing in these statements guards, refuses, or clamps the push.  The
`ReadyToPush` premise restricts only the executions for which the capacity
conclusion is proved.
