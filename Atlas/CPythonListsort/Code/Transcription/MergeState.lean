# `MergeState` and pending runs

The C structure mixes pointers, signed machine words, an active prefix of a
fixed-size stack, and temporary storage whose slots may be uninitialized. The
model keeps those observable distinctions while replacing pointers by indices
into one shared `SortSlice` store.
