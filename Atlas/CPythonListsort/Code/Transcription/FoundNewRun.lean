# PowerSort policy step for a newly found run

`found_new_run` computes the node power separating the current top pending
run from the newly discovered run, collapses strictly larger powers, and then
stores the new power on the surviving top run.  The caller remains responsible
for pushing the new run.

/-- Transcription of CPython's `found_new_run`.

The empty-stack branch is an explicit no-op.  For a nonempty stack, the guard
records the assertion domain inherited from `powerloop`: adjacent run lengths
are positive and the two runs lie within the nonnegative list length.  A
failure of the fixed 64-step power loop is observable as fuel exhaustion.
The source's debug-only post-loop strictness assertion is not turned into a
release-mode refusal branch. -/
