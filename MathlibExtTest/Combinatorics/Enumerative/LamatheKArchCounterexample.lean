# Lamathe k-arch counterexample

The code `({1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6})` over labels `[1, 6]` admits no initial
decoding vertex: every label occurs in a block, so the complement of the
blocks in `[1, 6]` is empty. This is the smallest counterexample given by
Caminiti and Fusco to Lamathe's counting formula for labeled k-arch graphs
(`k = 2`, `n = 6`).

k-arch Graphs*, Journal of Integer Sequences 10 (2007), Article 07.7.5,
