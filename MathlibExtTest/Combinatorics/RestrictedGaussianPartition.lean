-- q = 1 is rejected: 1 is not a prime power.
example : ¬ IsRestrictedGaussianPartition 1 1 ⟨[1], by decide⟩ := by

-- n = 0 is rejected.
example : ¬ IsRestrictedGaussianPartition 2 0 ⟨[], by decide⟩ := by

-- Three-level chain with strictly decreasing lefts: consecutive linkage holds,
-- while the first and last levels disagree (2 ≠ 3), so an all-pairs check fails.
