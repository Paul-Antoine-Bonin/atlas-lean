# Research Problems in Function Theory — Problem 2.90

Source: Hayman, Research Problems in Function Theory (2018), Problem 2.90
(M. R. Herman). Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07200.

Clause list from the source (every item appears in the formal text below):
1. quantifier domain of the unknown: α ranges over ℝ.
2. α is irrational: α ∈ ℝ ∖ ℚ.
3. α does not satisfy a diophantine condition.
4. quantified objects f are diffeomorphisms of the circle (bijective with
  two-sided inverse lifts, modeled via degree-one lifts F : ℝ → ℝ with
  F (x + 1) = F x + 1).
5. each f is ℝ-analytic (lift and inverse lift are analytic on all of ℝ).
6. each f is orientation-preserving (lift is strictly monotone increasing).
7. each f has rotation number α (Poincaré mean-motion limit equals α).
8. the conjugacy h is ℝ-analytic (witness is an analytic circle diffeomorphism).
9. the conjugacy target is a (rigid) rotation (lift y ↦ y + α).
10. main quantifiers: existence of one α such that every such f is
  ℝ-analytically conjugated to the rotation.
Context only (not a formal target): if α satisfies a diophantine condition,
the global analytic conjugacy theorem holds (Herman, Yoccoz).

/-- Diophantine condition on a real number, in the standard inhomogeneous
approximation sense: some margin γ > 0 and exponent τ ≥ 0 bound
|α - p / q| from below by γ / q ^ (2 + τ) for all integers p and all
positive integers q.

/-- Real-analytic orientation-preserving diffeomorphism of the circle,
modeled by its degree-one lift F : ℝ → ℝ to the universal cover.
Characteristic properties: analyticity of the lift and of the inverse lift,
degree-one periodicity F (x + 1) = F x + 1 (circle map), two-sided inverse
(diffeomorphism), and strict monotonicity (orientation-preserving).

there exists an analytic orientation-preserving circle diffeomorphism H whose
lift intertwines F with the translation y ↦ y + α, i.e. H ∘ F = R_α ∘ H.

α satisfying no diophantine condition such that every ℝ-analytic
orientation-preserving diffeomorphism of the circle with rotation number α
is ℝ-analytically conjugated to a rotation?

Resolved true: Yoccoz (Analytic linearization of circle diffeomorphisms, LNM 1784, 2002)
characterized the Herman class H of rotation numbers for which every analytic circle
diffeomorphism is analytically linearizable and proved CD strictly contained in H; any alpha in
H minus CD is the required non-Diophantine number. Source: H. Eliasson, B. Fayad and R.
