/-- A finite set of natural numbers is sum-free: no sum of two (not necessarily
distinct) members lies in the set [GREEN-001]. -/

  ∀ x ∈ s, ∀ y ∈ s, x + y ∉ s

/-- Large sum-free subset question from [GREEN-001] (Ben Green, Problem 1):
there exists an unbounded function `ω`, with `ω(n) → ∞` as `n → ∞`, such that
every finite set `A` of positive integers contains a sum-free subset `B ⊆ A`
of size at least `|A| / 3 + ω(|A|)`. -/

      ∃ B : Finset ℕ, B ⊆ A ∧ IsSumFree B ∧
        (A.card : ℝ) / 3 + ω (A.card) ≤ (B.card : ℝ)

/--
Resolved true: Resolved affirmatively by Bedert, who proves that every n-element set of integers
contains a sum-free subset of size at least n/3 + c log log n for an absolute constant c > 0.
