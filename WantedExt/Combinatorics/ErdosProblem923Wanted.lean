/-! Source record `FC-ErdosProblem923`, ported from FormalConjectures
`ErdosProblems/923.lean` (`theorem erdos_923`) and checked against
erdosproblems.com/923. The upstream `answer(True)` is dropped; the
right-hand side is stated directly (FC's `open SimpleGraph` is replaced by
qualified names). Status: resolved true by Rödl [Ro77]; this repository records
the statement but does not include a proof module. -/

/-- Every graph of large chromatic number contains a triangle-free subgraph
of arbitrarily large chromatic number. -/
def conjecture : Prop :=
  ∀ n : ℕ, ∃ k : ℕ, ∀ (V : Type*) (G : SimpleGraph V),
