Resolved true: Mathialagan (Electron. J. Combin. 28(4) (2021) P4.33, arXiv:1912.01883) proved
that for 2 <= m <= n^(1/3), some point of an m-set determines Omega(sqrt(mn)) distances to an
n-set; with Elekes's circle-grid construction this gives alpha_k = Theta(sqrt(k)), so alpha_k
tends to infinity. Source: S. Mathialagan, On bipartite distinct distances in the plane,
