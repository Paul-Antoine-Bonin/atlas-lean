# Mid-sized divisors of binomial coefficients

Erdős Problem 387 asks for an absolute positive constant `c` such that every
nontrivial binomial coefficient `n.choose k` has a divisor `d` in the interval
`(c n, n]`.

whose size is bounded below by a fixed positive proportion of `n`. -/

Resolved false: Bui, Naprienko, Pratt and Zaharescu (arXiv:2605.21221, 2026), Theorem 1.4: for
arbitrarily large k there are infinitely many n such that C(n,k) has no divisor in (n*241 log
log k/log k, n], so no fixed c>0 works and the Lean existential is false. Source: H. M. Bui, S.
