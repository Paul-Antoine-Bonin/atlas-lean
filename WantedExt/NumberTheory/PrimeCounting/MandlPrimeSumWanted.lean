/-- Mandl's inequality for the sum of the first `n` primes (statement only).

For every `n ≥ 9`, twice the sum of the first `n` primes is at most `n`
times the `n`th prime. The source's one-indexed primes `p₁, …, pₙ` become
zero-indexed `Nat.nth Nat.Prime 0, …, Nat.nth Nat.Prime (n - 1)`, and the
denominator in Mandl's inequality is cleared.

Dusart proved the inequality for every `n ≥ 9`, as quoted by Axler.
