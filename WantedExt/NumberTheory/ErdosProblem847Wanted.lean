/-! Source record `FC-ErdosProblem847`, ported from FormalConjectures
`ErdosProblems/847.lean` and checked against erdosproblems.com/847.
`ThreeAPFree` is reused from `Mathlib.Combinatorics.Additive.AP.Three.Defs`.
The source proposition is preserved; its external disproof by
Reiher–Rödl–Sales [RRS24] and a pinned external Lean proof are recorded in the
registry. This module states the proposition but does not refute it. -/

/-- Every `n`-subset holds a large 3AP-free subset. -/
def HasFew3APs (A : Set ℕ) := ∃ (ε : ℝ), ε > 0 ∧
  ∀ (B : Set ℕ), B ⊆ A → Finite B →
  ∃ (C : Set ℕ), C ⊆ B ∧ C.ncard ≥ ε * B.ncard ∧ ThreeAPFree C

/-- Every infinite set with uniformly large 3AP-free subsets is a finite union
of 3AP-free sets. -/

Resolved false: Resolved false externally by Reiher, Rödl, and Sales. This repository records
the historical proposition, not a proof. Source: Christian Reiher, Vojtěch Rödl, and Marcelo
