in the source's `K_m` convention, the nodes other than the distinguished
starting node form the complete directed graph on `m` nodes, so the Young
graph has `m + 1` total nodes including that distinguished start; `[0, 0]`
is one of the `m` non-start nodes, and the starting node connects to every
node except `[0, 0]`. -/

under `2 ≤ k < g`, `Y(g, k)` is complete on `m` nodes iff
`⌊gcd(g - k, k ^ 2 - 1) / (k + 1)⌋ = m - 1`. In the source's `K_m`
convention, the nodes other than the distinguished starting node form the
complete directed graph on `m` nodes, so the Young graph has `m + 1` total
nodes including that distinguished start; `[0, 0]` is one of the `m`
non-start nodes. Natural-number division represents the source floor
because all quantities are nonnegative and the denominator is positive.

The hypothesis is `2 ≤ m`, not `1 ≤ m`. The corollary rests on Theorem
`thm:completegraph`, whose proof starts "Since $s_1$ exists", so it needs
`m - 1 ≥ 1`. For `m = 1` the class `K_1` contains no Young graph: every Young
graph is connected and contains `[0, 0]`, so the starting node has an edge to
some node other than `[0, 0]` (proof of Theorem `thm:0iso`), while a graph in
`K_1` has none. With `1 ≤ m`, `(g, k) = (10, 9)` and `m = 1` give
`gcd(1, 80) / 10 = 0 = m - 1`, but `Y(10, 9)` is the 1089 graph, not in `K_1`. -/
