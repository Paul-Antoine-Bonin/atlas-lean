/-- Nishioka's rationality-transcendence dichotomy for Mahler functions:
a `k`-Mahler function `F ∈ ℂ[[z]]` that is algebraic over `ℂ[z]` is a rational
function.

Provenance: Jason P. Bell, Michael Coons, and Eric Rowland, "The
Rational-Transcendental Dichotomy of Mahler Functions", Journal of Integer
Sequences 16 (2013), Article 13.2.10, Nishioka corollary lines 238–241,
<https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL16/Bell/bell2.tex>.
The corollary is attributed to Ku. Nishioka, "Mahler Functions and
Transcendence", Lecture Notes in Mathematics 1294, Theorem 5.1.7. -/
