Resolved false: Adamczewski, Böhmler and Marczinzik (arXiv:2609.07996, 2026; Lean 4
machine-checked by Adamczewski) build, over any countable field F, a nil algebra N such that
M2(F1+N) has two nil left ideals with non-nil sum. Greenfeld, King and Vendramin
(arXiv:2609.15080) give an independent refutation. Source: Tom Adamczewski, Bernhard Böhmler and
